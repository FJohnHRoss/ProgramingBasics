      <p>
        I played football for all of my childhood to highschool. But my sophmore
        year I tore my acl and had a rough recovery. I ended up having to quit
        and found new intrest playing a new video game called Fortnite. I became
        a "proffesional" Fortnite player about a year after starting playing pc
        for the first time. That is what introduced me into wanting to code and
        thats what pushed me to become what I want to do today. Currently I have
        been playing WoW more commonly known as World of Warcraft. I have been
        playing for about a year.

      <h3 class="headPad">Anime</h3>

      <p class="headPad">
        I never thought I would have like anime when I first started to watch
        it. But pretty much as soon as I started watching Death Note I fell in
        nose deep. I read a manga called Tokyo Ghoul and it took me away. The
        story was like none I have read or watched before. I also related to the
        main character
        <a href="https://tokyoghoul.fandom.com/wiki/Ken_Kaneki">Kaneki</a>
        not to as extreme as him. But with my acl story the same sense of thing
        happened inside of the story. Although if you plan on watching Tokyo
        Ghoul, I would HIGHLY recomend reading the manga because the company
        that produced Tokyo Ghouls anime went off script quite a bit and it
        wasn't a good adaptation.
