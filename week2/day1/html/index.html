    <h3>About Myself</h3>
    <p>I played football for all of my childhood to highschool.
      But my sophmore year I tore my acl and had a rough recovery.
      I ended up having to quit and found new intrest playing a new
      video game called Fortnite. I became a "proffesional" Fortnite
      player about a year after starting playing pc for the first time.
      That is what introduced me into wanting to code and thats what
      pushed me to become what I want to do today. Currently I have been playing
      WoW more commonly known as World of Warcraft. I have been playing for about a year.

    <h3>Anime</h3>

    <p>I never thought I would have like anime when I first started to watch it.
      But pretty much as soon as I started watching Death Note I fell in nose deep.
      I read a manga called Tokyo Ghoul and it took me away. The story was like none
      I have read or watched before. I also related to the main character 
      <a class="link" href="https://tokyoghoul.fandom.com/wiki/Ken_Kaneki">Kaneki</a>
      not to as extreme as him. But with my acl story the same sense of thing happened
      inside of the story. Although if you plan on watching Tokyo Ghoul, I would HIGHLY
      recomend reading the manga because the company that produced Tokyo Ghouls anime
      went off script quite a bit and it wasn't a good adaptation.
